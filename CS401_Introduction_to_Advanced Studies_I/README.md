# CS401: Introduction to Advanced Studies I

Welcome to the **CS401: Introduction to Advanced Studies I**. This repository showcases key projects, assignments, and concepts from **CS401: Introduction to Advanced Studies I**, a comprehensive course focused on building strong foundations in **Java programming**, **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **object-oriented programming (OOP)**. This portfolio highlights my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and proficiency in computer science concepts essential for software development roles.

## **Lab Descriptions**

### **Lab 01: Object-Oriented Programming Basics**

Learned to create a Java program that calculates the area of a circle while applying object-oriented programming concepts and proper code documentation.

---

### **Lab 02: Comparing Objects**

Gained experience in comparing student records using `compareTo` and `Comparator` interfaces, focusing on Names and IDs.

---

### **Lab 03: Sorting Algorithms & Complexity Analysis**

Analyzed runtime complexity and implemented the Selection Sort algorithm to understand sorting principles and performance.

---

### **Lab 04: Stack Implementation**

Built a Stack data structure using an array to manage Employee objects, practicing file I/O and data structure design.

---

### **Lab 05: Recursion and Iterative Algorithms**

Implemented recursive and iterative solutions for the Jacobsthal sequence and created a method to find the minimum value in an array.

---

### **Lab 06: Queue Implementation**

Developed two types of queue implementations using arrays and performed various operations on Employee objects.

---

### **Lab 07: Data Structures and Algorithm Mastery**

Implemented sorting, searching, stack usage, and a palindrome check to master core data structure and algorithm concepts.

---

### **Lab 08: Linked List Implementation**

Created linked list implementations (basic, sorted, circular, doubly linked) to enhance understanding of linked list structures.

---

### **Lab 09: Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations**

Built a Binary Search Tree (BST) with traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order) and performed tree analysis.

## **Final Project**

**Project Title:** Data Structures & Algorithm Showcase with GUI

**Skills Demonstrated:** Algorithm Design, GUI Development, Performance Analysis

**Project Highlights:**
- Implemented and compared data structures (arrays, linked lists) for data storage and retrieval.
- Built a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize and interact with data structures.
- Analyzed and documented the performance of different implementations.

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my understanding of data structures, efficient algorithms, and user-friendly interface design.
