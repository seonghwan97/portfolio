</div>

**Hi everyone!** I’m a master’s student in Computer Science with a **deep passion for computer vision and machine learning**. I love designing and fine-tuning neural network architectures, implementing advanced algorithms, and applying feature extraction techniques to solve practical challenges. My core interest is leveraging computer vision across diverse fields—logistics, bioengineering, human performance analysis, or aviation—to create high-impact solutions that genuinely make a difference.

In the logistics sector, I created an **object detection** program that leverages complex neural network architectures to precisely identify which items are being stored, enabling more efficient inventory management. In one bioengineering lab, I focus on **real-time microfluid mixing detection** and control to ensure optimal flow conditions. Meanwhile, in the other group, I’m a research co-pilot exploring **CT and MRI imaging for organ segmentation**.

My interests also extend to analyzing **3D human pose** data to evaluate performance and energy usage—insights that could transform how we train athletes, improve workplace ergonomics, and more. Additionally, I’m engaged in a **drone-based 3D scanning** project for aircraft structural inspections, where automated and accurate defect detection can save time, cost, and potentially lives.
