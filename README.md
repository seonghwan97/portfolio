**Hi everyone!** I’m a highly motivated **master’s student in Computer Science** with a strong background in **computer vision** and **machine learning**. My passion lies in designing and fine-tuning neural network architectures, implementing advanced machine learning algorithms, and applying feature extraction techniques to solve real-world challenges. I’m eager to leverage my expertise in **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow** to drive innovation in computer vision and data analysis, and I can’t wait to share my work and collaborate with others who are just as excited about AI as I am.

I’m particularly fascinated by the potential of computer vision to revolutionize industries, from automating inspections and detecting anomalies to supporting medical diagnostics and enhancing mixed reality experiences. I love experimenting with different architectures—refining a convolutional network for object detection or integrating multi-modal data like depth, EEG, or sensor input to build truly immersive solutions.

Beyond the technical side, I thrive on tackling real-world challenges through hands-on projects and interdisciplinary collaboration. I aim to develop robust, scalable solutions that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and actual deployment. Combining my curiosity for diverse technologies with my passion for high-impact innovation, I aim to contribute to a future where computer vision transforms how we work, learn, and explore the world around us.
