</div>

Hello Everyone! I am a **Master of Science in Computer Science** student at the Illinois Institute of Technology with a deep passion for **computer vision**, **deep learning**, and **AI-driven innovation**. I thrive on designing and refining neural network 
architectures, implementing advanced machine learning algorithms, and applying feature extraction techniques to address real-world challenges.

I specialize in **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**, leveraging these frameworks to develop and optimize high-performance models that drive tangible results. My work includes projects such as the **Logistics Smart Inspection System**, where I used state-of-the-art object detection to automate product inspections; the **Marionette Motion Control System**, integrating motion tracking and real-time motor control; and **Incremental Learning Enhancements**, highlighting my experience in knowledge distillation and model optimization.

Focusing on clean, maintainable code and a results-driven approach, I produce solutions that can stand up to real-world deployment. Whether fine-tuning a convolutional neural network for higher accuracy or architecting robust pipelines for end-to-end computer vision tasks, I am committed to **continuous learning**, **collaborative problem-solving**, and **delivering meaningful impact** in every project.
